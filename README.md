# RISC-V
A single-Cycled Processor with RISC-V architecture
This 32-bit single cycle RISC-V processor is designed following RISC-V architecture with its standard ISA using Verilog HDL and according to the general principles described in the book "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by David Harris and Sarah Harris.

Every instruction is totally fetched, decoded and executed in a single clock cycle.

You can find below figures of supported instructions it's about the most of them

Finally, QuestaSim simulation environment was used to simulate the operation of the design and The project was tested by using a comprehensive set of various instruction formats to ensure its complete functionality.

I also used VIVADO to evaluate the RTL and the Synthesized design:

This is the design RISC-V:
