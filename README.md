# RISC-V
A single-Cycled Processor with RISC-V architecture
This 32-bit single cycle RISC-V processor is designed following RISC-V architecture with its standard ISA using Verilog HDL and according to the general principles described in the book "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" by David Harris and Sarah Harris.

Every instruction is totally fetched, decoded and executed in a single clock cycle.

You can find below figures of supported instructions it's about the most of them





and this is the design:
